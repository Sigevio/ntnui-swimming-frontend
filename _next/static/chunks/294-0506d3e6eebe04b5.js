We do not have any perticular demands for expertise, except that you have to be able to swim 50 metres without any aids. At practice there is always a program made by our coach. Beyond this there is no organising or follow-up. Each semester we arrange two or more crawl-courses, where our members can participate for a little fee. We also arrange courses to become a swim judge, and a lot of social happenings. Beers after friday practices is an old tradition of ours. The same applies for the cabin trip.
